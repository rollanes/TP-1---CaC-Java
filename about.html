      <p class="about-singer">
        <b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989 (age 33)) is an
        American singer-songwriter, record producer, actress, director,
        philanthropist, and businesswoman. Her discography spans multiple genres
        and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal
        life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.
      </p>
      <p class="about-singer">
        Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville,
        Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She
        signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a
        recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released her
        eponymous
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_(album)"
          >debut studio album</a
        >
        in 2006. She explored country pop on her second and third studio albums,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor_Swift_album)"
          >Fearless</a
        >
        (2008) and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Now">Speak Now</a>
        (2010). The success of the former's singles "Love Story" and "You Belong
        with Me" on both country and pop radio established Swift as a leading
        crossover artist. She experimented further with pop, rock, and
        electronic genres on her fourth studio album,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(Taylor_Swift_album)">Red</a>
        (2012). Her fifth, the synth-pop album
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album)"
          >1989</a
        >
        (2014), effectively transformed her status from country songstress to
        pop star, supported by the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_It_Off">"Shake It Off"</a>,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blank_Space">"Blank Space"</a>,
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)"
          >"Bad Blood"</a
        >. The media scrutiny on her personal life that followed largely
        inspired Swift's sixth studio album,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_(album)"
          >Reputation</a
        >
        (2017), which delved into urban sounds.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Machine_Records"

          >Republic Records</a
        >
        in 2018, Swift released her seventh studio album,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lover_(album)">Lover</a>, in
        2019. After consistent commercial success in the 2010s, she ventured
        into indie folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio
        albums,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)"
          >Folklore</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)"
          >Evermore</a
        >
        (2020). Her lyricism on the two albums, inspired by escapism during the
        COVID-19 pandemic, was commended for its nuanced storytelling. To gain
        ownership over the masters of her back catalog, Swift released two
        re-recorded albums in 2021,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(Taylor%27s_Version)"
          >Fearless (Taylor's Version)</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(Taylor%27s_Version)"
          >Red (Taylor's Version)</a
        >, earning acclaim for their enhanced musicality and stronger vocals. In
        2023, she released her tenth studio album,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights">Midnights</a>. Besides
        music, Swift has starred in various supporting acting roles in films
        such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)"
          >Valentine's Day</a
        >
        (2010) and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_(2019_film)">Cats</a>
        (2019). She has released the autobiographical documentary
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Americana"
          >Miss Americana</a
        >
        (2020), and the self-directed musical films

        (2021), amongst other specials.
